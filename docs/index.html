      <h2>You Were Lied to Your Entire Life.</h2>
      <p>My grandparents grew up in the Soviet Union and were force-fed bullshit their entire lives. </p>
      <p>They learned fictitious versions of Russian history and had to memorize made-up biographies of barely cognoscente men.</p>
      <p>If you don't question everything, there’s a chance that you'll believe retarded bullshit for a large part of your life.</p>
      <p>So the question is, are things better in Amerikee land of freedom, Ronald Reagan and eagle tears, or are we inundated with half-truths and propaganda in an Empire of Lies?</p>
      <p>In every Social Science class, you were repeatedly lied to. Here's your history textbook's <a href="https://31.media.tumblr.com/6ae729c1575b9e1462345c3823699689/tumblr_inline_mxgdyluTM51rpr1t4.png" target="_blank">picture of George Washington</a> and here is the <a href="https://31.media.tumblr.com/ed0e9c3a5f3157399f1fafd212ce0b0e/tumblr_inline_mxgdzpDDqC1rpr1t4.png" target="_blank">full picture</a>.</p>
      <p>Your Psychology teacher will talk about Sigmund Freud and his theories of childhood development. But she won't talk about his theories on women and or how he railed cocaine <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfNluQ888g4" target="_blank">like it was 1980.</a></p>
      <p>The Social sciences are taught in a way that intentionally avoids intellectual debate. </p>
      <p>These people don't want to have a discussion. These people don't care about the truth they care about the lesson plan.</p>
      <p>These people want you to conform and believe in their fictitious politically correct world.</p>
      <p>You need to come to your own conclusions. You need to see the world for what it really is.</p>
      <p>It is a world where…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Women are indoctrinated to marry their job and leave you childless.</li>
        <li>Men are far more inferior than their fathers and a complete disgrace compared to our great grandfathers.</li>
        <li>A surplus of resources has produced a surplus population and now the elites are cleaning up the mess.</li>
        <li>Conservatives want to fight abortion but can't even trick a white bitch into having a few more babies.</li>
        <li>Your government goes out of its way to import people and uses your tax money to house them.</li>
        <li>The average man is looking for a “Red Pill” but aren’t willing to work to change.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The average man is a loser.</h2>
      <p>He's overweight, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LAlt8.jpg" target="_blank">out of shape</a>, doesn't make much money, eats shitty food, and doesn't do that well with women.</p>
      <p>He lives a normal, unremarkable life and is forgotten not long after he is buried. The worst thing you can do for yourself is to become average.</p>
      <p>Most people are average and are great at giving <a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/fc71a51d8938d618f62f8d8951d5e559/tumblr_mwwezjmN5D1scwp42o1_1280.jpg" target="_blank">advice on how you can become even more average</a>.</p>
      <p><em>“Hey man, you’re working too hard, you should take a break.”</em></p>
      <p><em>“You shouldn't use that girl for sex, she deserves a relationship.”</em></p>
      <p><em>“Your wife cheated on you, but you should forgive her.”</em></p>
      <p><em>“You shouldn't go so heavy on deadlift and squat its bad for your back.”</em></p>
      <p>Now if you’re here, then you probably trying to be more than an average man.</p>
      <p>You’ve probably tried:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleaning your room</li>
        <li>Holding frame</li>
        <li>Washing your pee-pee</li>
        <li>Every single "Red Pill" pick-up line</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Or maybe you’re a kid fresh out of school who’s realized the manosphere is a joke.</p>
      <h2>Let me tell you my story.</h2>
      <p>In 2014 I got bored of watching YouTube videos and playing StarCraft 2 so I started Skyping dudes playing recreational therapist. </p>
      <p>I thought that would be more entertaining than a reality TV video game.</p>
      <p>I Skyped close to 1000 people in 5 years. Law school sort of prepared me for manipulating dudes out of depression and into the gym.</p>
      <p>Along the way, I didn’t hesitate to call them a faggot retard. And I only do it because I actually care a lot.</p>
      <p>I want to slap the kids here awake because there is a huge bullshit train coming right at them and they need to save themselves.</p>
      <p>To help them save themselves, I put them through rigorous political theory and bodybuilding.</p>
      <p>You can see what one of my guys has to say:</p>

      <h2>So why should you work with me?</h2>
      <p>I will teach you how to weaponize Lacanian psychoanalysis and push you to make real gains in the gym.</p>
      <p>I will open a world of esoteric texts and lay them in the palm of your hand for you to read.</p>
      <p>And by reading, I don’t mean skim through like a college textbook.</p>
      <p>You will have a hard time understanding things in these books that my guys and I have already figured out through grueling phone calls. </p>
      <p>I will help you push through so you can join their ranks in <em>our private, invite-only community.</em></p>
      <p>Now I couldn’t list every single concept in every book that I’ve covered with my clients.</p>
      <p>But here’s one.</p>
      <h3>Commodity Fetishism.</h3>
      <p>In Marxist philosophy, every commodity has Use and Symbolic Value. I’m very deliberate with capitalization here as each term has an objective meaning.</p>
      <p>Jeeps are Used as off-road vehicles. A Jeep Symbolizes that its driver is a cool rugged off-road adventure guy. A pink Jeep and a blue Jeep have the same Use Value.</p>
      <p>However, a Pink Jeep and a Blue Jeep have different Symbolic Value.</p>
      <p>Because a Pink Jeep symbolizes that its driver is a big gay faggot desperate for his asshole to get 9-11ed.</p>
      <p>Now imagine you’re driving down the street in your pink Jeep and everyone's yelling: FAGGOT!</p> 
      <p>No matter how many times you yell “it's just a Jeep” nobody is gonna care.</p>
      <p>Likewise, it doesn't matter how many times you yell “I'm Not a Nazi” in your swastika Jeep.</p>
      <p>Symbolic Value although socially constructed still has real effects. Denying Symbolic Value doesn't make it go away.</p>
      <p>Now when you apply this to women…</p>
      <p>Sluts love denying Symbolic Value because it allows them to pretend they're not sluts. Sluts love to put on <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/47/f5/4b47f5a6e9538bd0e91019b826483d8a.jpg" target="_blank">Slut dresses</a> and tell their fathers/boyfriends/husbands:</p>
      <p><em>“It's just a dress! Why do you have to be so controlling dad? I'm just going out with my friends!”</em></p>
      <p>By that logic, a Swastika Shirt is just a shirt.</p>
      <p>Contrary to SlutLogic, symbols are real and humanity has been communicating with symbols since its existence.</p>
      <h2>Now, why is all this important?</h2>
      <p>Because the <a href="https://youtu.be/6T_Rj47nm0Q" target="_blank">Matrix</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZYd2dHnJqyg" target="_blank">Fight Club</a> movies that the manosphere jerks off to are built on Commodity Fetishism.</p>
      <p>Just like sluts, the system can only function via deliberate unknowing.</p>
      <p>Useless people hide from their useless lives by hoarding objects with only symbolic value.</p>
      <p>Miserable people hide from their miserable lives in false virtual worlds.</p>
      <p>Empty hollow average people pretend that they have substance so they don't have to do anything about their misery.</p>
      <p>What you’ve just learned is far more encompassing and bitter than most are willing to admit.</p>
      <p>In order for a Slut to successfully slut she has to simultaneously perform the physical actions of a slut while symbolically denying that she's a slut.</p>
      <p>The moment she acknowledges that she's a slut she has to take responsibility and critically consider her actions. That's the last thing a slut wants to do.</p>
      <p>That's why when a dick appears inside a slut <em>“lol idk it just happened.”</em></p>
      <p>SlutConfusion is deliberate and necessary for the functioning of the Capitalist slut economy.</p>
      <p>You’re going to learn about this great dissonance and more as we go through books together.</p>
      <h2>What about getting big?</h2>
      <p>Next time you're at the gym, take a good look around.</p>
      <p>Do you think the elliptical chubster will lose weight?</p>
      <p>Will the curl bro gain muscle?</p>
      <p>Is the old Asian woman going to stop inventing exercises?</p>
      <p>No. 90% of the people in the gym will never improve.</p>
      <p>They're perfectly happy hurping and durping to top 40.</p>
      <p>Failure is the default. If you don't wake the fuck up and separate yourself from the pack you're going to end up like everybody else, a failure.</p>
      <p>Luckily for you, my years of training and working as a trainer will help you cut through the bullshit and get you big fast.</p>
      <p>See for yourself:</p>
